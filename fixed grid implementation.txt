WHAT IS OUR ARRAY
1d array of length 16


HOW IT WORKS
each element of the array need to point to its 1st particle, or -1 if it has none

each particle needs to point to the next particle, or -1 if it is the last particle

when testing a particle collision, we get its cell and test collisiosn for cells within. We might also need to test collisions from neighbouring cells. Might need to create function that returns cells surounding a particle, what if it is massive?

when a particle moves we need to see if it has left a cell. If so remove it from the current cell(make sure the particles are still linked). Then add it to the cell it has moved to (last particle points to this cell now). Consider if the cell has no particles.



HOW TO ACTUALLY LINK CELLS AND PARTICLES
grid is an array 
array contains X cells
each cell contains Y particles
Hence we have a 2d array: grid[cell[particle,particle....], cell[particle]]
cells will




PROBLEMS BEN MIGHT HAVE MISSED
when moving a particle are you removing from a cell and correctly adding to another?
does self.id change? probs not
x y mix up?
