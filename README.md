# Particle-system

## Overview

This is just a very simple particle simulation with lots of areas to explore
We will start with just the basics such as creating particle classes and detecting wall collisions
Then we will move onto more complex stuff like particle on particle collision
Along the way we will try to make optimisations such as using quad trees and a variety of other stuff.
